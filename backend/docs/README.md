## 🎯 Quick Start for New Developers

### 1. **Start Here** 📖
Begin with the [Architecture Documentation](./ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the overall system design and principles.

### 2. **Understand Data Access** 🗃️
Read the [Repository Pattern Guide](./REPOSITORY_PATTERN.md) to understand how data persistence is handled.

### 3. **Learn API Patterns** 🚀
Study the [API Design Guidelines](./API_GUIDELINES.md) before creating or modifying any endpoints.

### 4. **Security First** 🔐
Review [Authentication & Authorization](./AUTHENTICATION.md) to understand security patterns and implementation.

Check [Database Conventions](./DATABASE.md) when working with schema changes or database operations.

## 🛠️ Implementation Workflow

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Design** - Review architecture docs and plan the feature according to established patterns
2. **Database** - Design schema changes following database conventions
3. **Repository** - Implement data access layer using repository pattern
4. **Service** - Create business logic in service layer
5. **API** - Design REST endpoints following API guidelines
6. **Security** - Implement authentication/authorization as needed
7. **Tests** - Write comprehensive tests for all layers
8. **Documentation** - Update relevant documentation
